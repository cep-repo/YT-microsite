YT's 2018 Focus Sprint MVP

## The focus sprint project for 2018 is: automate microsites!!!

Here is the technology we're using: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/

The idea is to be able to quickly create web pages displaying high-level, publicly-sharable data findings for our clients. This would work for both schools and districts.

To take a look from your own computer, git clone, then do `gatsby develop`

To push to production, run `gatsby build`.

Woohoo!
